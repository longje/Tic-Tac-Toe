Description:
A simple game of tic tac toe.  

Features:
	The user may reset the board at any time.
	A line will be drawn through the winning 3 moves.
	When a user clicks on the board, a blue highlight will be drawn.  This highlight shows the user where their move will be placed.

Future improvements:
	The intelligence of the computer is fairly limited at the moment, but will be improved in the future.
		I intend to implement the max-min method described in "A Modern Approach" to AI by Peter N. and Stuart R.
	I also intend to place another status label into the frame, showing the number of games played and who has won them.
	Possibly implement multiplayer.
